GraphQL on HTTP middleware with built-in validations and GraphQL playground

## What

It provides GraphQL on HTTP middleware that can be embedded in any server.

Essentially, it takes a `Request` object and returns a `Response` object.

In the meantime, it performs HTTP request validation, processes GraphQL, and
response object with the appropriate status code and message.

There is also a built-in GraphQL Playground.

## Example

A simple example of creating a GraphQL server.

[std/http](https://deno.land/std/http) +
[grpahql.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)

```ts
import { graphqlHttp } from "https://deno.land/x/graphql_http@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import {
  Handler,
  serve,
  Status,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import { buildSchema } from "https://esm.sh/graphql@$VERSION";

const schema = `type Query {
  hello: String!
}
`;
const graphqlResponse = graphqlHttp({
  schema: buildSchema(schema),
  rootValue: {
    hello: () => "world",
  },
  playground: true,
});

const handler: Handler = (req) => {
  const { pathname } = new URL(req.url);
  if (pathname === "/graphql") {
    return graphqlResponse(req);
  }

  return new Response("Not Found", {
    status: Status.NotFound,
  });
};

serve(handler);
```

## Spec

This project is implemented in accordance with
[GraphQL over HTTP Spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/).

### Response Status

The following response statuses may be returned. These are
[Request errors](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors.Request-errors) and
[Field errors](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors.Field-errors) and all
statuses are `200` in case of Field errors.

| Status | Condition                                                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200    | If GraphQL is actually executed, even if it contains `Field errors`.                              |
| 400    | A required parameter does not exist. Illegal format of parameter.                                 |
| 405    | When a mutation operation is requested on GET request.                                            |
| 406    | The client `Accept` HTTP header does not contain at least one of the supported media types.       |
| 415    | The client `Content-type` HTTP header does not contain at least one of the supported media types. |
| 500    | If the server encounters an unexpected error.                                                     |
